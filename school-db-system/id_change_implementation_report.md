# ID Property Change Implementation Report

## Summary
All entity ID properties across the multi-tenant school management system have been successfully converted from integer types to string GUIDs. This change enhances the system's scalability, security, and uniqueness of identifiers across tenants.

## Changes Implemented

1. **Entity Models**
   - Updated `BaseEntity` class to use string GUID IDs with automatic generation
   - Modified all entities inheriting from `BaseEntity` to use the new ID type
   - Updated all entities with composite keys and direct ID definitions
   - Changed all foreign key properties to string type

2. **Database Configuration**
   - Updated `ApplicationDbContext` configurations to support string GUID IDs
   - Modified entity relationship configurations to maintain proper constraints
   - Ensured all composite key definitions use string type

3. **Authentication Domain**
   - Verified and updated authentication domain entities to use string GUIDs
   - Ensured consistency between main domain and authentication domain entities

4. **Repository and Service Layers**
   - Modified repository interfaces to use string IDs in all methods
   - Updated all repository implementations to handle string GUID IDs
   - Ensured service layer implementations properly handle string IDs

## Benefits

1. **Scalability**: GUIDs can be generated without a central authority, making distributed systems easier to implement
2. **Security**: Non-sequential IDs prevent enumeration attacks
3. **Uniqueness**: Virtually eliminates the risk of ID collisions across tenants
4. **Consistency**: Provides a uniform ID strategy across all entities

## Migration Considerations

When deploying these changes to an existing database:
- A database migration will be required to convert all ID columns
- Data migration will need to convert existing integer IDs to string GUIDs
- All foreign key constraints will need to be dropped and recreated
- Application downtime will be necessary during the migration

## Files Updated

### Core Entities
- BaseEntity.cs and all derived entities
- All entities with composite keys and direct ID definitions
- All entities with foreign key references

### Database Configuration
- ApplicationDbContext.cs and related configuration files

### Authentication Domain
- All authentication domain entities and their references

### Repository and Service Layers
- IGenericRepository.cs and all derived repository interfaces
- All repository and service implementations
