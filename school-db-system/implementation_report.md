# Multi-Tenant School Management System - Implementation Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents a complete implementation of a multi-tenant database system for Ghanaian Basic and JHS schools using ASP.NET Core 6 and PostgreSQL with a code-first approach. The system follows a shared database with separate schemas architecture, providing optimal balance between resource efficiency and tenant isolation.

## Project Deliverables

This package includes the following deliverables:

1. **Database Requirements Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of the multi-tenant database requirements based on the PRD
2. **Database Schema Design**: Detailed schema design documentation for the shared database with schema-per-tenant approach
3. **Entity Models**: Complete set of entity models for all domains in the school management system
4. **Multi-Tenancy Infrastructure**: Implementation of tenant resolution, context management, and schema selection
5. **Migration Scripts**: Code-first migrations for PostgreSQL with support for tenant provisioning
6. **Validation Report**: Verification of the implementation against PRD requirements and best practices
7. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of the schema and multi-tenancy strategy

## Implementation Highlights

### Multi-Tenancy Approach

The system implements a shared database with separate schemas approach where:

- All tenants share a single PostgreSQL database instance
- Each tenant has its own dedicated schema named `tenant_{id}`
- Common reference data is stored in a `common` schema
- Tenant management data is stored in a `master` schema

This approach provides:

- Strong data isolation at the database level
- Efficient resource utilization
- Simplified maintenance and backups
- Cost-effective scaling to thousands of schools

### Key Technical Features

1. **Dynamic Schema Selection**: Runtime schema selection based on tenant context
2. **Tenant Resolution**: Domain and header-based tenant identification
3. **Automated Provisioning**: One-click tenant creation with schema and initial data
4. **Code-First Migrations**: Structured migration approach for schema evolution
5. **Entity Framework Core**: Modern ORM with full PostgreSQL support
6. **Repository Pattern**: Clean separation of data access concerns

### Domain Coverage

The implementation covers all core domains required for Ghanaian schools:

- **User Management**: Users, roles, and permissions
- **Student Management**: Students, guardians, enrollments, and attendance
- **Academic Management**: Academic years, terms, grades, sections, and subjects
- **Staff Management**: Staff records and teaching assignments
- **Financial Management**: Fee types, structures, invoices, and payments
- **Assessment Management**: Assessments and results
- **Communication**: Announcements and messaging
- **Resource Management**: Resources and allocations

## Implementation Details

### Project Structure

The solution follows a clean architecture approach with these key components:

- **SchoolManagement.Core**: Contains domain entities and interfaces
- **SchoolManagement.Infrastructure**: Contains data access and multi-tenancy implementation
- **SchoolManagement.API**: Contains API controllers and application services

### Entity Framework Configuration

The `ApplicationDbContext` is configured to dynamically select the appropriate schema for each entity based on the current tenant context:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    // Master schema entities
    modelBuilder.Entity<Tenant>().ToTable("tenants", "master");
    
    // Common schema entities
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>().ToTable("users", "common");
    
    // Tenant-specific entities
    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(_tenantInfo?.SchemaName))
    {
        modelBuilder.Entity<Student>().ToTable("students", _tenantInfo.SchemaName);
        // Additional tenant-specific entities...
    }
    
    // Configure relationships...
}
```

### Multi-Tenancy Middleware

The tenant resolution middleware identifies the current tenant for each request:

```csharp
public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context, ITenantResolver resolver)
{
    // Resolve tenant from the request
    var tenant = await resolver.ResolveTenantAsync(context);
    
    if (tenant != null)
    {
        // Store tenant info in the HTTP context
        context.Items["TenantInfo"] = tenant;
    }
    
    // Continue with the request pipeline
    await _next(context);
}
```

### Migration and Tenant Provisioning

The `TenantMigrationService` handles both initial migrations and new tenant provisioning:

```csharp
// Apply base migrations for master and common schemas
public async Task MigrateBaseSchemaAsync()
{
    await context.Database.ExecuteSqlRawAsync("CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS master;");
    await context.Database.ExecuteSqlRawAsync("CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS common;");
    await context.Database.MigrateAsync();
}

// Provision a new tenant with its own schema
public async Task ProvisionTenantAsync(Tenant tenant)
{
    await context.Database.ExecuteSqlRawAsync($"CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS {tenant.SchemaName};");
    await ApplyTenantMigrationsAsync(context, tenant.SchemaName);
    await InitializeTenantDataAsync(context, tenant);
}
```

## Getting Started

To use this implementation in your project:

1. **Database Setup**:
   - Install PostgreSQL 12 or higher
   - Create a new database for the school management system
   - Configure the connection string in `appsettings.json`

2. **Application Setup**:
   - Clone the repository
   - Restore NuGet packages
   - Run initial migrations: `dotnet ef database update`
   - Start the application: `dotnet run`

3. **Creating a New Tenant**:
   - Use the `/api/tenants` endpoint to create a new tenant
   - The system will automatically create the schema and initialize it
   - Access the tenant using its domain or by specifying the tenant ID in the header

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a robust, scalable, and secure foundation for a multi-tenant school management system specifically designed for Ghanaian Basic and JHS schools. The shared database with separate schemas approach offers an optimal balance between resource efficiency and tenant isolation, while the code-first implementation ensures maintainability and extensibility as the system evolves.

The solution is ready for integration with front-end applications and can be extended with additional features as needed.
