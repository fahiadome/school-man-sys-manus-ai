# Product Requirement Document (PRD)
# Multi-Tenant School Management System for Ghanaian Basic and JHS Schools

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This Product Requirement Document (PRD) outlines the comprehensive requirements, architecture, and features for a multi-tenant school management system specifically designed for Ghanaian Basic and Junior High Schools (JHS). The document serves as a definitive reference for stakeholders involved in the development, implementation, and deployment of the system, ensuring alignment with the unique educational, administrative, and infrastructural context of Ghana.

### 1.2 Background

Ghana's educational system follows a 6-3-3-4 structure, with Basic Education encompassing 6 years of primary education and 3 years of Junior High School. This foundational education is critical to the nation's development goals and faces several challenges, including administrative inefficiencies, resource constraints, infrastructure limitations, and connectivity issues, particularly in rural areas.

Traditional school management approaches in Ghana often rely on manual, paper-based processes that are time-consuming, error-prone, and limit data-driven decision making. While some urban schools have adopted standalone digital solutions, these systems typically operate in isolation, preventing efficient resource sharing and standardization across the educational landscape.

A multi-tenant school management system offers significant potential to address these challenges by providing a unified platform that can accommodate diverse school environments while optimizing resource utilization, standardizing processes, and facilitating collaboration. By leveraging cloud technologies with robust offline capabilities, such a system can function effectively even in areas with limited connectivity, bringing modern management tools to schools throughout Ghana.

### 1.3 Scope

This PRD covers the requirements, architecture, and features for a comprehensive multi-tenant school management system designed specifically for Ghanaian Basic and JHS schools. The system will address the following key areas:

- Student information management and academic tracking
- Teacher and staff administration
- Curriculum and academic management aligned with Ghanaian standards
- Communication and collaboration among stakeholders
- Financial management and resource allocation
- Reporting and analytics for data-driven decision making
- Multi-tenant administration and customization
- Integration with external educational systems and services

The system will be designed to function effectively across diverse infrastructure environments, from well-connected urban schools to remote rural institutions with limited connectivity. It will support both English and major Ghanaian languages, accommodate local administrative practices, and comply with relevant educational policies and data protection regulations.
